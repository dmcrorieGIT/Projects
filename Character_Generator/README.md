RUNEQUEST CHARACTER GENERATOR

I built this program in my second year, most of the data is hard-coded as I had not learned to read from data files at this point.
This program prompts the user on how he/she would like to build his/her character. When the prompts are finished, a .txt file with the
details of the character sheet are outputted. The intent of this program was to save time for members of the table-top community
who play this particular game.
